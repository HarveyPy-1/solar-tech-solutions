				<label for="question1">How does Solar Panel work?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					A Solar PV system works by collecting the light rays from the sun,
					this is done by a number of Solar panels (an array), which is
					normally mounted on the roof.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each solar panel is made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, wired
					together in the panel. These cells are made up of layers of silicon
					and look a bit like blue or black tiles, held together in a neat
					waterproof, clear-topped panel
				</p>
				<p>
					When daylight hits the cells it creates electricity, the brighter
					the sunlight, the more electricity is produced.
				</p>

			<!-- Question & Answer #2 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question2">
				<label for="question2">How reliable are solar panels?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						Since the systems have practically ZERO moving parts the systems are
						extremely reliable and efficient. We always recommend that systems
						are inspected annually to ensure they are working at optimum levels.
						Please see our maintenance packages
					</p>
				
			</div>

			<!-- Question & Answer #3 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question3">
				<label for="question3">Do I need planning permission?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						You do not require planning permission for roof mounted solar
						installations if they are under 1MW (Permitted Government
						development rights). However you may need planning permission IF
						your building is listed OR situated in a conservation area.
					</p>
				
			</div>
			</li>
			<!-- Question & Answer #4 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question4">
				<label for="question4">Will my roof be able to accomodate solar panels?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						Most roofs can accommodate solar however if the roof is in poor
						condition then we may have to look at different methods of mounting.
						We can quickly asses your roof via our <a href="">online enquiry</a>
					</p>
				
			</div>
			</li>
			<!-- Question & Answer #5 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question5">
				<label for="question5">How long does it take to instal solar panels?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						This is very much dependant as you might expect as to the size of
						the installation and the layout of the site, however as a rough
						guide a 30-50 KW system can be designed, fitted and tested within
						3-4 days.
					</p>
			</div>
			</li>
			<!-- Question & Answer #6 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question6">
				<label for="question6">How do I maintain my solar panels equipment?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						Solar Panel systems require very little in the way of maintenance,
						however we do advice that with any other electrical connection that
						the system is checked every 12 months to ensure its performing at
						optimum levels. We have created a bespoke maintenance package which
						gives your business the security that you are getting the best from
						your system.
					</p>	
			</div>
			</li>
			<!-- Question & Answer #7 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question7">
				<label for="question7">Will my solar panel work in cloudy, Autum and Winter?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						The system works as long as there is daylight, However the output is
						affected by varying amounts dependant on shading and cloud cover. We
						as designers can optimise your system accordingly to benefit from
						the most efficient layout and angle of panels.
					</p>
			</div>
			</li>
			<!-- Question & Answer #8 -->
			<li>
				<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="question8">
				<label for="question8">What happens if I move home or business?</label>
				<div class="content"><p>
					<p>
						This is not a problem at all as the system is viewed as an asset to
						your business and will add value if you decide to sell your
						premises. If you have a PPA agreement this is also fine as the
						agreement can easily be transferred to the new owners/tenants to the
						building allowing them to benefit from far cheaper energy bills.
